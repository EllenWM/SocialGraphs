Feeling shamed by his failure decades earlier, he permanentally adorned his face with a black cowl and scarred the faces of his children in a ritual design.[3] Seeing mercantilism as inherently dishonorable,[4] he began funding violent political activity, and ordered his two sons to assassinate the Japanese Prime Minister; they died in the attempt.[3]Intending to employ the assassin Bullseye, he freed him from prison and performed surgeries to replace the damaged bone in his vertebrae with adamantium.[5] Daredevil pursued Bullseye to his estate.
