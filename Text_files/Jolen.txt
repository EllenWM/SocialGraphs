The team is then confronted by the Fantastic Four and are quickly defeated. The Fantastic Four turned the Inhuman team over to the Office of National Security (ONE), where they were detained.[7]After being freed by Mala the Diviner and Dewoz, they retrieve the Terrigen crystals as well as capture the holder of the crystals, Dr. Cartwrite. Having accomplished their mission, they return to their moon base.[8]Due to his race, he is gifted with a number of abilities in addition to that of a normal human.
