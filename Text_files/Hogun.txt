He joined with Volstagg and Fandral to judge a dare and formed a lifelong friendship. This dare, the "petting" of the Fenris wolf, led to a humiliating defeat for all three men. Afterwards, legends and tales would then stop referring to Hogun in cheerful terms and use dour, negative names.[3]He is primarily characterized by his brusque, taciturn, and often short-tempered demeanor. He is the brooding pessimist of the group, as opposed to Volstagg's irrepressible good humor and Fandral's brash heroism.
