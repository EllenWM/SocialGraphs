Gorgon is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Gorgon is also a member of the Royal Family of the Inhumans, a race of superpowered beings that inhabit the hidden city of Attilan.Gorgon was portrayed by Eme Ikwuakor in the 2017 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) television series Inhumans.The character debuted in Fantastic Four #44 (Nov. 1965) and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.[1]The son of archivist Milena and architect Korath (brother of the previous king Agon), Gorgon Petragon[2] is a cousin of king Black Bolt and a member of the Royal Family of the Inhumans. As is custom among the Inhumans, Gorgon was exposed to the Terrigen Mists as a teenager, gaining increased strength, while his feet were transformed to hooves, capable of generating highly destructive seismic waves. As an adult, Gorgon became Black Bolt's personal bodyguard and is responsible for training youths recently exposed to the Terrigen Mists in the use of their newly acquired powers and abilities.Gorgon first leaves the Inhuman city of Attilan to rescue Medusa (suffering from amnesia at the time), who became lost in the outside world. This leads to a battle with the Fantastic Four, who rescued Medusa from the supervillain team the Frightful Four.[3] After making contact with the outside world, Gorgon and the rest of the Royal Family have several encounters with the Fantastic Four over the years, seeking their aid against foes such as Black Bolt's brother Maximus,[4][5] Psycho-Man,[6] and the Sphinx.[7]With several other Inhumans, Gorgon also battles the master villain Mandarin,[8] helps free Maximus,[9] journeys to America to search for the missing Black Bolt,[10] and battles Magneto.[11] Over the years, and with continued exposure to the outside world, Gorgon has many adventures, usually taking place in the company of fellow members of the Royal Family.[12]Significant moments for Gorgon include defying the Attilan Genetics Council and helping to hide the pregnant Medusa (with Black Bolt's child) on Earth;[13] and arguing with Black Bolt over the use of Alpha Primitives as slaves.[14] He leads an Inhuman force down to Earth to gain the return of the Terrigen Mists. This goes badly as many human captives are slain by an impatient Inhuman named Jolen. This sparks a war between Earth and the Inhumans, and Gorgon is captured. He is subjected to the Terrigen Mists again. This amplifies Gorgon's powers and change him into a true beast with a lion-like head, claws, and uncontrollable rages.[15] As with the other Inhumans, he leaves the Moon to assist them in taking over the Kree empire.[16] He is later seen with his more humanoid appearance.[17]In the Inhuman storyline, he is shot in the spine by NuHuman named Lineage, he is paralyzed waist down and cannot use his powers.[18]As part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel, Gorgon joined the diplomatic mission created by Medusa to oversee the diplomatic relations and handle the recovery efforts of the newly transformed Inhumans. During this time, Gorgon rode around in a special wheelchair. His paralysis is later cured by NuHuman Panacea.[19]During the Inhumans vs. X-Men storyline, Gorgon and Crystal are ambushed by Magneto.[20]Gorgon's superhuman powers are a result of exposure to the mutagenic Terrigen Mist. Gorgon now has bull's legs and hooves and can create intense shockwaves equivalent to a powerful earthquake. He also possesses enhanced strength and durability, although like all Inhumans he has a weaker immune system than that of an average human.Gorgon was exposed to Terrigen Mists a second time by Pentagon officials. He then appeared larger and stronger and behaved more brutishly.[15] These changes gradually faded.[17]In Amalgam Comics, Big Gorgon – a combination of DC Comics' Big Bear and Marvel's Gorgon – is a member of the superhero group the Un-People in the Amalgam Comics universe.[21]In Earth X, like many of his fellow Inhumans, the Gorgon of Earth X has undergone a further mutation and possesses the head of a bull.[22]In Marvel Zombies, the first time the zombified Gorgon is seen, he is part of a horde of super-zombies attempting to eat the last few known humans left on Earth. They fail; the humans are safely escorted to another reality.[23] Later, it is seen that the entire Inhuman Royal Family has been zombified and has traveled to Kingpin's domain to eat of his human clones. Machine Man attacks and Gorgon tries to retaliate by stamping the ground, but his leg instantly falls off.[24]In the Ultimate Marvel reality, Gorgon is female (the sister of Medusa and Crystal) and possesses the added ability to hypnotize people.[25]
