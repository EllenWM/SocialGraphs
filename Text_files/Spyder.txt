His lifespan was apparently fixed at 100 years. He was sometimes seen levitating while in a deep meditative trance. He had a symbiotic rapport with Parallax, an entity which bound the multiple personalities of Century into a unified self.Since developing amnesia, Century couldn't remember much about his past and often had to search for the right words which led to Century sounding like a thesaurus when he often used three similar words to express himself. Single memories returned when he was confronted with something from his past or he dreamt about it. After losing Parallax for a while, memories of his composite minds loosened and even after Parallax was returned to him he continued to remember bits from the lives of the Hodomur he was composed of.To defeat the evil Nexus Being named Lore, responsible for the destruction of their world, the Hodomur race created Century, a being composed of the best 100 surviving Hodomur warriors.

After killing Broker for good, he returned to Earth, rejoining Force Works in time to help them unravel the plot of Kang (Immortus in disguise) that had on his side a corrupted Iron Man and Cybermancer, alternate version of scientist Suzi Endo. After Stark sacrificed himself to prevent Kang's plans, Force Works had to endure a last fight against alternate universe versions of Wonder Man, and Ultron, belonging to Cybermancer's reality.

After calling Tinkerer who makes him an updated Clash suit, Clayton calls up Stromm.[80] In his new suit, Clash arrives at Stromm's apartment where he finds Stromm in the Robot Master appearance and robots. Robot Master then compliments Clash's outfit and claims that Spider-Man won't know what happened. When Clash attacks Robot Master stating that he will look out for himself, Robot Master unleashes his robots on Clash even when Spider-Man arrives. Spider-Man manages to web Robot Master in the air with foam web. When Spider-Man was talking Clash into getting back to the civilized life, Robot Master rises and attacks them. While Clash flies away, Spider-Man defeats Robot Master by ripping the remote control mechanics from within the robot body, deactivating the robot army. When Clayton states that he was trying to protect Parker Industries from Stromm, Spider-Man stated that he caused harm with his technology, caused millions of dollars worth of damages, and violated his parole. Though Parker did talk to Clayton's parole officer where he stated that Clayton acted in self-defense and that Clayton will have to give up on working on sonic technology. Though Clayton doesn't seem to agree with Spider-Man's proposal to discontinue his work on his sonic technology which leads to Ulysses' vision coming true.[82] After battling Spider-Man on the streets, Clash escapes and returns to the Moynihan's Social Club where he decides to be a crime boss.[84]Clash was seen at the closed Now Forever Nightclub where he discusses with his thugs the plans to take back his inventions that he made for Parker Industries to evade them being sold to pay off some debts.

While Spider-Man catches Clash's thugs, he allows Clash to get away.[85]During the "Go Down Swinging" storyline, Peter later persuades Clash to look over the Osborn family in light of the Red Goblin's threat. At Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Clash assists Human Torch in protecting the Osborn family from Red Goblin. Their attacks do nothing against Red Goblin because the Goblin formula made the Carnage symbiote immune to fire and sound. Red Goblin then proceeds to defeat Human Torch, Clash, Silk, Miles Morales, and Agent Anti-Venom.[86]Clash possesses a genius-level intellect. He can also utilize sonic technology to various uses.Isadore "Izzy" Cohen is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. His first appearance was in Sgt.

Copycat first appeared in X-Force #19 (February 1993), where the character was retconned to the first appearance of Domino in The New Mutants #98  (February 1991), and was created by Fabian Nicieza and Greg Capullo.[89]The character has been depicted as a former member of X-Force. Copycat is such a powerful and precise metamorph that she can duplicate another being down to the cellular level.Actress Morena Baccarin portrays a non-mutant Vanessa Carlysle in the 2016 film Deadpool and the 2018 film Deadpool 2.The daughter of Dorothy and the late Burt Carlysle, of New Brunswick, New Jersey,[90] as a young mutant shape-shifter kicked out of her home, Vanessa Carlysle fell into a life of prostitution in Boston where she met and fell in love with a mercenary named Wade Wilson. Carlysle was soon saved from Wilson's vengeful employers by Zoe Culloden, a time-traveling agent of Landau, Luckman, and Lake who had journeyed into the past to prevent Wilson's eventual self-destruction. That night, Wilson broke up with Carlysle after learning he had terminal illness, leaving her heartbroken. Carlysle became a mercenary herself, eventually employed by arms-dealer Tolliver.Under his orders, Copycat infiltrated X-Force in the shape of Domino while the real Domino was a prisoner. Her mission was to blow up X-Force's headquarters to kill Cable, but she became attached to the team members, fell in love with Cable and didn't go through with her mission. Tolliver sent Deadpool to force her to set the bomb. Deadpool would be put in her place, if she refused. Deadpool revealed Copycat's cover to X-Force, and left them for dead by blowing up the complex without knowing that X-Force had already escaped.Vanessa briefly hid herself under the false identity (as a twin) of one of her friends; Tina Valentino. Deadpool and his associate, Sluggo, believing they killed her, killed Tina instead. She then moved in with Garrison Kane in San Francisco, until Cable found them.[91] She was subsequently captured by the emotion-manipulating Psycho-Man, who sought Kane's advanced technology, but was rescued from the Microverse by Kane, Cable, Domino and the Microverse's resident heroes, the Microns. Later, she broke up with Kane and came back to live with Deadpool. Deadpool's feelings towards Siryn grew, so she left him after having taken his appearance to attack her, in hopes of souring their potential relationship.Some time later, Copycat was captured by Weapon X. The treatments of Weapon X destroyed her memory and she forgot her mission. Recruited by Sabretooth, Deadpool received an order to kill her. He tried to warn her, so Weapon X sent Kane to kill the both of them. The fight took them to a local zoo where Deadpool left her in a shapechanged-gorilla form among other gorillas to fight against Kane. When he returned, the other gorillas were dead and Copycat was dying from wounds inflicted by Sabretooth. She died shortly after in Deadpool's arms.[92]However, Deadpool had poured an amount of his blood into Copycat's wounds, which, unknown to him, healed her. Vanessa then took up the identity of an owner of a chimichanga stand, and later cheated Deadpool out of one of his past marriages.[93]Copycat is such a powerful and precise metamorph that she can duplicate another being down to the cellular level. Because of this, she is able to replicate superhuman powers, abilities, and even mental imprints so closely that telepaths have trouble identifying her. Copycat simply requires knowledge to duplicate someone's appearance, but needs physical contact to duplicate anything else. She is also capable of turning into animals, finding these forms easier to maintain than human shape.[94] Weapon X modified her powers by accelerating the rate at which she could duplicate others. However, as a side effect of this enhancement, Copycat began to lose her memory and was unable to hold any solid form for long periods of time.In the Age of Apocalypse reality, Copycat was a member of the Brotherhood of Chaos, an elite religious group affiliated to the Church of the Madri. She served alongside other members such as Madison Jeffries and Spyne. She was often referred to as Sister Vanessa or Sister Carlysle. Using her shape-shifting powers, Copycat was able to hide incognito amongst the humans who had hoped to flee North America and was able to discover the site of the Sentinel Evacuation while in their midst. Vanessa led the Brotherhood to an emigration site in Maine and there they clashed with the Amazing X-Men. In an attempt to elude the X-Man Quicksilver, Copycat posed as Scarlet Witch, but was forced to revert to her normal self by Dazzler. Both Copycat and Box were able to escape the X-Men and conceal themselves, posing as humans, and escaped to Europe. They were discovered at a checkpoint and provided a distraction for a group of Altered Humans to pass through, but were subsequently hunted down by Weapon X and Jean Grey, with the latter slaying Vanessa in the process.[95]In the Age of X reality, Copycat infiltrated Cannonball's X-Force when she worked for the Human Coalition. She was unmasked and killed by Husk.[96]Gilberto "Gil" Corazon is a minor character in Marvel Comics.

But when Anya gets wounded, Gil filed a restraining order to keep Anya safe.[101][102][103] Gil is also an acquaintance of the Fantastic Four.[104] After accepting his daughter as Spider-Girl, Gil is killed[105] with the Red Hulk framed as the apparent killer,[106] by the Raven Society organization.[107]Sofia Corazon is a minor character in Marvel Comics.

The robot initially had a fully feminine human appearance, and was referred to as "she" by its creators to the point that Jaxon himself was unaware of "her" true nature.[110] Courtney acted on Jaxon's behalf to recruit several superhumans that were former members of Gamma Flight and Beta Flight (the Canadian government's training teams) that were dismissed after the government closed Department H, the division that oversaw Gamma, Beta, and the primary Alpha Flight team.[111] Jaxon intended to form a personal super-team to revenge on James MacDonald Hudson, founder of Department H and leader of the still-active Alpha Flight as Guardian, and Courtney was able to manipulate the already-disenfranchised recruits into seeking their own revenge on Alpha through an "influencer" device built into its systems.[112] However, Courtney was unable to influence Roger Bochs (inventor of the Box robot) who was still loyal to Hudson and the Flight program, forcing Jaxon to directly involve himself by taking control of Box.[110]Luring James and Heather Hudson to America with an offer of employment at Roxxon's New York City holdings, Jaxon and Omega Flight executed an ambush of Guardian while Heather was detained by Courtney. When Heather made an attempt to escape and scuffled with Courtney, the robot's flesh-like facial covering was damaged and its true nature revealed. While Omega Flight's goal of revenge was attained with Guardian's apparent death, Courtney was witness to Jaxon's own death due to feedback from Box's destruction,[110] and Omega's remaining members were turned over to the New York City authorities.[113]Escaping capture, Courtney freed Omega Flight from jail and employed the group in a new plot against Alpha Flight. Having its appearance reconfigured and incorporating facsimiles of Guardian's battle-suit technology into its systems, Courtney infiltrated Alpha Flight posing as Guardian and eventually lured the group into a second encounter with Omega Flight, using Alpha's trust of "Guardian" to ambush.[114] However, Omega Flight's victory was foiled by the Beyonder's arrival,[115] and Courtney and its team were forced to flee.Their escape was blocked by Madison Jeffries, a former Flight trainee whom Courtney had avoided recruiting, fearing his ability to control machines and his loyalty to James. When Jeffries attacked with a construct created from an automobile, Courtney used one of the future duplicates of Omega Flight member Flashback as a human shield, resulting in its death (and the mental breakdown of the original Flashback, now condemned to violent death in his future). This enraged Jeffries, who used his powers to destroy Courtney, forcing its internal circuitry out of its mouth.[116]Bochs and Jeffries later salvaged portions of Courtney's second incarnation to construct a new battle-suit functionally identical to James's original,[117] which was used by Heather under the Vindicator identity.[118]Delphine Courtney possessed superhuman strength, and had a high degree of resistance to physical damage. Its sight and hearing were sharper than a human being's. It also possessed a device called an "influencer" that could affect pre-existing psychological conditions in the human mind, allowing Courtney to manipulate individuals with judicious use of the influencer combined with verbal interaction; however, it could not absolutely control human beings, as Roger Bochs' loyalty to James Hudson allowed him to resist its manipulations. Courtney was also able to disguise itself as a human being with a flesh-like outer covering. It could masquerade as either gender by altering its underlying structure, and could even impersonate specific individuals convincingly enough to fool those close to the person imitated. While impersonating James Hudson/Guardian, Courtney also contained technology that could replicate the properties of Guardian's original battle-suits, granting it all of its identity theft victim's super-powers.Augustine Cross is a fictional character in Marvel Comics.
