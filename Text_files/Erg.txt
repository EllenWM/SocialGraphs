They had the institute in sight when they were taken down by a shock grenade and tasers. The Leper Queen orders her men to kill them. The League members set up three St. Andrew's crosses (which are "X" shaped) with braces to keep the crosses upright. Erg is tied to one of the crosses. Gasoline was poured on and a lit match tossed. Erg regains consciousness when the lower legs of the cross were blazing. He would have died if he hadn't been yanked off by Wolverine. The X-Man had been sitting in the Xavier estate woods, letting Colossus sketch him.[1]Erg remained at the Xavier Institute with many other mutants, some unwillingly, becoming something of a ringleader for the non-X-Men members of the 198. It was Erg's idea to raise a "198" flag, the number representing what was originally thought to be the number of mutants left in the world after the Decimation.[2] He was also one of a few mutants who attacked Sentinel Squad O*N*E (Office of National Emergency) because they want to leave the Xavier estate.[volume & issue needed]Erg was also one of the unfortunate mutants who accepted having an electronic tag inserted in order to be allowed to go out on a supervised group trip to Salem Center. Dr. Cooper told the mutants that the tags were "...a harmless tracking device, inserted under the skin with a simple and painless surgical process". That was not true, as Erg later discovered, as the tags had the ability to generate disabling electronic pulses. Later, Mister M freed the chipped mutants of their devices.[volume & issue needed]During "The Extremists" arc, Erg reappeared alongside some of his fellow Morlocks under the leadership of Masque. Besides Erg, this group consisted of Bliss, Litterbug,  the undercover Skids, and the captured Leech.[3]Erg is shown as one of Norman Osborn's mutant prisoners after the riots in San Francisco.[4] He later took refuge on Utopia, and participated in the fight against the attacking Nimrods.[5]Erg is a mutant who is able to absorb all forms of energy and project them in blasts from his right eye, which he calls his "electric eye".
