Ronin is an alias used by multiple characters in the Marvel Comics Universe. It was first adopted by Maya Lopez in New Avengers #11 (November 2005) by Brian Michael Bendis and Joe Quesada. Following this, the Ronin mantle has been taken up by characters such as Clint Barton, Alexei Shostakov, Eric Brooks, and Bullseye.The Clint Barton incarnation of Ronin appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Avengers: Endgame (2019) and the Disney+ series Hawkeye (2021), portrayed by Jeremy Renner.The persona of Ronin was created by Brian Michael Bendis and Joe Quesada. Bendis stated that the original intention was Matt Murdock as the true identity of Ronin but could not do so due to a conflict with plans in the Daredevil comic book title.[1]The original iteration of Ronin first appeared in New Avengers #11 (November 2005) (although the character appeared on the covers of several earlier issues). Maya Lopez was the first person to take on the Ronin identity.[2]The second iteration of Ronin first appeared in New Avengers #27 (April 2007). Clinton "Clint" Barton is the second person to have used the Ronin identity.[3]Writer Jim McCann revealed "We're going to learn that there is far more to the Ronin identity than anyone knew, pre-dating [the first two versions] before [the third iteration]. Why does Ronin exist? That's a central mystery we will tackle."[4][5] A Life Model Decoy of Alexei Shostakov is the third individual who dons the Ronin identity.[6]A character (whose identity is initially kept from the reader) is introduced in the Mighty Avengers and dons the Halloween-type Spider Hero costume during the Infinity storyline,[7] and is supplied with the Ronin costume from a "big box of Clint Barton's old stuff" during the Inhumanity storyline.[8] Before being revealed in canon, a leaked script revealed the fourth iteration's true identity to be Eric Brooks.[9][10]In the Hawkeye: Freefall storyline, Clint becomes Ronin once more to launch an attack on the Hood's criminal empire. The Hood eventually hires Bullseye to find out Ronin's true identity. After learning that Clint is Ronin through his associates, the Hood then orders Bullseye to commit crimes dressed in the Ronin costume to ruin Clint's reputation.[11]The Ultimate Marvel equivalent of Ronin is an alternate personality of Marc Spector.[12] In order to infiltrate the Kingpin's forces, Ronin proves himself by luring Spider-Man into a fight. The two engage in a brutal battle while Ronin and Moon Knight fight a concurrent battle in Spector's mind. Ronin knocks Spider-Man unconscious and apparently "kills" Moon Knight before taking the youth to the Kingpin for interrogation.[12] However, the Kingpin attacks Ronin, revealing knowledge of Ronin's secret identity.[13] Two of the Kingpin's henchmen take Ronin to a river and execute him. However, Ronin survives his near fatal injuries and goes to the police to provide evidence about the Kingpin's attempt to murder him. He is forced to reveal his identity, but the Kingpin is arrested and the media refer to Spector as a hero.[14]In the "Heroes Reborn" miniseries, T'Challa briefly uses the Ronin identity to break into the Squadron Supreme's headquarters and steal files, only to be driven off by Nighthawk.[15]An original character named Nozomu Akatsuki operates as Ronin in the anime series Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers, voiced by Hideyuki Hori in the Japanese version and Keith Silverstein in the English dub.[16] The father of Akira and Hikaru Akatsuki, Nozomu is the co-developer of the DISKS (Digital Identity Securement Kit) before becoming Ronin.  Multiple versions of Ronin appear in live-action media set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
