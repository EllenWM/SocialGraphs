He wore a thick metal armor with a helmet and metallic gauntlets, and was armed with an arsenal of edged weapons and whirling, jagged circular sawblades made of titanium, one mounted on each gauntlet. Small rotors in the gauntlets cause the blades to rotate at high speeds, and the whirling blades could also be detached to serve as short-range missile weapons.[citation needed]In civilian life, Potter is an accomplished clothing designer, proficient in drafting, design and sewing.[20]In the alternate time of the 2005 "House of M" storyline, Gladiator appears as an assassin of the Kingpin.[21]The Ultimate Marvel universe version of Gladiator is an enemy of Spider-Man, and a crazed madman obsessed with "the emperor".[22]
