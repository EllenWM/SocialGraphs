The Marauders did succeed in annihilating a large number of the underground mutants. While the Marauders were accomplishing this, they also clashed with the X-Men,[3] X-Factor,[4] Thor,[5] and Power Pack.[6] With the Marauders, she also attempted to kill Madelyne Pryor.[7]Sinister later sent Vertigo along with the other Marauders to fight the X-Men in New York City just before the extra-dimensional incursion known as the "Inferno".[8] She was apparently killed in battle with the X-Men.[9] Her alliance with Sinister was short-lived at that time, as she soon rejoined her Savage Land Mutate allies.[volume & issue needed]Said allies join with the more peaceful of the Land's inhabitants to resist a territorial grab by humanoid saurians. Her powers are central in defeating the enemy army.

This power induces effects ranging from mild disorientation and vertigo to unconsciousness. Vertigo can focus her power on one or more individuals, or project it outward from herself in all directions, affecting everyone within her range of influence.Vertigo is not immune to her own powers, as she was thrown off balance when Thor reflected her psychic waves back at her with Mjolnir.In the Age of X reality Vertigo appeared as an X-Man.[16]Vertigo appears as a boss in Deadpool.[17] This version is a member of Mister Sinister's Marauders, who encounter the eponymous character after they unknowingly cost him a bounty.
