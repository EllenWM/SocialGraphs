Bloodsport is the name of several supervillains appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. All of these versions exist in DC's main shared universe, known as the DC Universe.[1][2][3]The Robert DuBois version of Bloodsport made his live-action debut in the television series Supergirl, played by David St. Louis.[4] In the DC Extended Universe, Robert DuBois is played by Idris Elba in the film The Suicide Squad (2021).[5]The character of Robert DuBois, created by writer and artist John Byrne, first appeared in Superman #4 (April 1987) as Bloodsport.[6][7] The second incarnation, Alexander Trent, made his first appearance in The Adventures of Superman #507 (December 1993) and was created by writer Karl Kesel and artist Barry Kitson.[8] The third incarnation, known as Bloodsport III, made his first appearance in Superman #652 (July 2006) and was created by writers Kurt Busiek and Geoff Johns, and artist Pete Woods.[9][10] Demolitia, a female version of Bloodsport, is introduced by writer David Michelinie, and artists Kieron Dwyer and Denis Rodier in Action Comics #718 (February 1996), in which she procured Bloodsport's technology.[11][12]Following the events of Dark Nights: Death Metal, DuBois was reintroduced back into the DC Universe. After his brother's death, his mental state deteriorated, leading him to become the mercenary Bloodsport. After failing to kill Superman, he was sent to Belle Reve until he was forced into the Suicide Squad with the task of exploring the Multiverse for Amanda Waller's own personal ambitions.DuBois pretends that he is a bitter Vietnam veteran who feels greatly betrayed and rejected by his country, thus he enjoys powerful and righteous anger toward his fellow Americans for wasting the freedoms invading Vietnam supposedly helped preserve.[51] However, he has no first-hand experience about this war, ergo, his speeches and character are largely drawn from movies about the war and folk representations of Vietnam War veterans. Though at first he seemed aware that his vet persona was fictional, he grew increasingly delusional and dissociated.[52][53] Described as a very violent and powerful man, DuBois was plunged into a permanent fantasy about being a soldier, and was even feared by the other dangerous prisoners at Stryker's Island Prison in Metropolis.[54]While Robert DuBois has no superhuman powers, he has proven to be a formidable hand-to-hand combatant when needed due to his excellent physical condition and his fearlessness as a fighter.[55] He's in possession of a device that enables him to teleport high-tech weaponry to him from a distant location instantaneously, with many being one-of-a-kind prototypes from advanced LexCorp research projects.[56][57][58][59] Superman has described the arsenal to be "extradimensional" in both quality and quantity.[60]He is incredibly strong and significantly more durable than the average human, as evidenced by his survival of several physical altercations with Superman.[61][62][26] DuBois' reflexes and senses are extraordinarily keen and allow him to respond to Deadshot and alarm Superman.[63][61][24] He's a quick and accurate shooter with a wide variety of firearms, from handguns to shoulder-fired weapons.[64] He's a fully ambidextrous marksman, and can shoot with either hand without any loss of accuracy or speed.[65] On top of his sheer size and musculature, the insane DuBois seems to have a significant level of manic strength and intensity:[66] In a boxing match, he stood toe-to-toe with Alexander Trent, a man with borderline superhuman strength and reflexes.[67][64]
