Femizon is the name of two fictional groups appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.The first group to be called Femizons were the women of Femizonia, a gynarchic future world in an alternate timeline where women had become Amazon-like warriors, ruling over male slaves. It was this world that produced Thundra, a recurring enemy, and later ally, of The Thing.[1]The second group to be called Femizons was a group of all-female supervillains in the Marvel Comics universe. They were enemies mainly for Captain America, and their goal was to conquer Earth and create a utopia where women ruled. Led by Superia, who claimed to be inspired by stories of Thundra's Femizons, the group consisted of a large number of established female criminals and super villainesses. Superia gained Blackbird, Iron Maiden, MODAM, Moonstone, and Nightshade as her lieutenants.[2]In the group shot, there are two unidentified members of the Femizons who are briefly shown.
