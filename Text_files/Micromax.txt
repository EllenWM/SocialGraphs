They are assigned to track down the perpetrator of the previous thefts and initially erroneously accuse Nightcrawler of sabotage. After that mishap, they are overpowered by a servant creature of Necrom, a powerful sorcerer.[2] They later encounter Necrom himself, and Micromax is the only one to survive the mission, due to his shrinking abilities.[3] He unsuccessfully attempts to kill Necrom.
