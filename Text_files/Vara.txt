Superman & Batman: Generations is the umbrella title of three Elseworlds comic book limited series published by DC Comics in the United States, written and illustrated by John Byrne. A major concept of the series is the avoidance of so-called comic book time; it places Superman, Batman, and the other members of the DC Universe in a single timeline, showing the characters aging and being replaced by their progeny.The Elseworlds story Batman & Captain America, co-published with Marvel Comics and written/drawn by John Byrne, was released in 1996. The story features Batman and Robin teaming up with Captain America and Bucky to fight the Joker and the Red Skull in 1945. The epilogue of the tale features Dick Grayson as Batman and Bruce Wayne Jr. as Robin. The duo find the frozen Captain America in the 1960s while searching for the Joker Jr. It is from this epilogue that the Generations concept was spun-off and developed.Superman & Batman: Generations was published as a four-issue limited series in Prestige Format from January to April 1999. It was later collected as a trade paperback (ISBN 1-56389-605-2) in 1999.Superman & Batman: Generations 2, like its predecessor, is a four-issue Prestige Format limited series that ran from October 2001 to January 2002; it dealt with other DC heroes in chapters set between the times of the stories in the first series. It was also collected as a trade paperback (ISBN 1-56389-990-6) in 2003.Superman & Batman: Generations 3 is a 12-part limited series. Unlike the previous two series, it was published in standard format and ran from March 2003 to February 2004. No trade paperback has been published for this series as of this date.In 2021 all three series were collected in an omnibus (ISBN 1-77950-940-5).Generations follows Superman and Batman from the beginning of their careers to the far future. Each issue contains two stories; each story takes places 10 years after the previous one.The second series, rather than using a 10-year jump between stories as in the original, takes jumps of 11 years. Starting in 1942, each issue again tells two stories, ending in the year 2019 at the end of issue #4. While the first series focused on the Batman and Superman families, the second features other characters from the DC Universe, especially from the Justice Society and Justice League.Generations 3 starts in the year 1925, with each subsequent issue jumping forward 100 years, with the exception of issues #7 and 8, which both partially dealt with the 26th century and the 19th century, respectively. The story features characters from the future timelines of the DC Universe, as well as Jack Kirby's New Gods.Over the course of the third series, Generations III, a dynasty is created that spans many centuries. Most of this is undone by the series' end.For clarification:
