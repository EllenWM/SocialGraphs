I think Marie Severin designed the costume pretty much on her own."[4]Walter Newell first appears in the title Tales to Astonish  as an oceanographer working for the United States government. The character encounters the human/Atlantean hybrid hero Namor the Sub-Mariner and his lover Lady Dorma, while supervising the construction of a domed sub-sea city whose purpose is to harvest food for mankind.

The suit also gives him enhanced swimming speed and its streamlined wings allow him to glide through air for great distances.
