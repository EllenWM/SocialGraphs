The Iron Patriot Drones are sent to attack Iran to which S.H.I.E.L.D. sent the Hulk in response.[11] S.H.I.E.L.D. uses holographic communication to hack into the A.I.M. network so the Iron Patriot Drones can understand these programmed actions are wrong.[7]The Iron Patriot Drones are next seen during the "Inhumanity" storyline as the Secret Avengers' support involving the Inhumans until being disabled by the Junkman's technopathic abilities.[12]Dr. Toni Ho wore two versions of her own Iron Patriot armor as a member of the U.S. Avengers; a standard version,[13] and a heavy combat variation.[14][15]Sharon Carter briefly wore the Iron Patriot armor to combat Selene.[16]The American Son is another patriotic-themed exoskeleton used by Harry Osborn during the "Dark Reign" storyline,[17] and later by Gabriel Stacy.[18]The Iron Hulk is an alias used by Robert Maverick / Red Hulk.[19]A variation of Steve Rogers utilized elements of Tony Stark's armor in order to control Hydra as the Hydra Supreme / Civil Warrior.[20] The armor would later be utilized by Veronica Eden.[21]The Ultimate Marvel equivalent of the Iron Patriot appears due to Tony Stark / Iron Man inspired by Steve Rogers / Captain America for the Ultimates.[22][23]
