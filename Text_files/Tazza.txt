Initially, creator Jim Valentino wanted to use Wolverine in a storyline where the Guardians had briefly returned to Earth, but Bob Harras, the X-Men editor of the time, did not want it established that Wolverine could live that long.  Thus, Valentino created Talon, influenced by Steve Englehart's take on the Beast during Beast's "party hearty" time with the Avengers.[1] Valentino later stated that Talon "wasn't gay, as some people thought. I thought it would lighten things up to have a happy-go-lucky screw-up on the team since, when looked at properly, the Guardians were not a superhero team, but rather a light army."[2]Talon has some superhuman abilities thanks to his genetically superior Inhuman physiology, and has possibly been exposed to the mutagenic Terrigen Mist. He has a feline form: an orange fur-covered body, razor-sharp talons on his hands and feet, pointed ears, pronounced canine teeth, and a 31⁄2' prehensile tail. He has superhuman strength, is an Olympic-level acrobat and gymnast, and is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant. The talons on his hands and feet can be detached and hurled as weapons, then regrow instantly.Tangerine is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

The Carbones were led by Julius, whose second in-command was his brother, Salvatore.[43] While Julius welcomed Mickey and the Punisher (who had adopted the alias "Johnny Tower") into the organization, Sal disliked the two, and was suspicious of their motives, correctly assuming that they were sabotaging the Carbones' operations.[44]Needing leverage to get Sal off of their backs, Mickey and the Punisher spied on him, and discovered that he was consorting with rival Asian gangsters. Enraged by Sal's treachery, Julius ordered Mickey and the Punisher to dispose of him, so the two drugged Sal and drove him out to New Jersey. Due to his frequent narcotics usage, Sal was able to resist the drugs he was given and tried to flee, but fell through the ice of a frozen lake. Believing Sal to have perished, Mickey and the Punisher left.[45]Sal survived, and regained consciousness in a hospital, which he escaped from.[46] Recalling nothing about his past other than vague details about the people who had tried to kill him, Sal robbed and murdered a man, and began making his way to La Isla de Tiburones Durmientes, which was where Julius's daughter was about to marry a Sicilian mobster. When a motorist he had flagged down asked him what his name was, Sal, unable to remember, replied with Thorn, a word he had glimpsed on a billboard.[47]After swimming to La Isla de Tiburones Durmientes, Thorn ran amok, killing his niece's fiancé and Julius, among others.

After massacring the head dealer and his underlings, Thorn and the Punisher continued their brawl, which ended when the Punisher threw Thorn off of a bridge, and onto a moving truck. The truck brought Thorn to New Jersey, and he was last seen wandering Newark.[50]For unexplained reasons, nearly dying in a frigid lake has left Thorn unable to feel pain, allowing him to sustain severe injuries, such as multiple gunshots, without being deterred. Thorn's brush with death has also eliminated his need for basic human necessities such as food, water, air, and protection from the elements, and made him repellent towards animals such as sharks.In a 2009 interview with Comic Book Resources, illustrator Dale Eaglesham expressed fondness for the character, stating "I spent some time in the Punisher department from 93 to 95 and I really enjoyed working with Frank Castle. However, there's another Punisher-related character that I feel I have unfinished business with: Sal Carbone, the man they call Thorn. He went toe-to-toe with Castle and survived because he thinks he's already dead. He's insane, and he would actually make a great Punisher! Maybe I can talk Ed Brubaker into that one; I think he would love it".[51]Thorn ranked #4 on The Robot's Voice list "The 8 Worst Punisher Villains Ever".[52]Thornn is a fictional mutant, a member of the Morlocks.

After capturing Wonder Man, they were convinced by him to allow him to join them in their campaign against Hollywood by making their own film.[68]When the U.S. Agent assumed the part Wonder Man had been playing in "The Demon That Devoured Hollywood", the Night Shift attacked him, and Tick-Tock slowed him down long enough for the Misfit, Digger and the Hangman to knock him out. Realizing that Wonder Man intended to betray them, they also brought Wonder Man down.[69] As the Night Shift continued with their film project, the Avengers attacked them, all on film.

Later, Deadpool left Leather Boy tied up in a tree to be attacked by squirrels.[94]Searching from a way to defeat Galactus, the Chtty and the Chrrt-chuks abducted Tippy-Toe (and Nancy Whitehead by mistake) and placed into a simulation to trick them into revealing the secrets of Galactus's defeat.[95]It was discovered that Chrrt-chuks were actually being extorted by a fake Silver Surfer.[96]Gaining a small portion of the Power Cosmic, Tippy-Toe tried to punish the grifters, but when she was outwitted, she gave the Power Cosmic to Nancy instead.[97]Titan is a size-shifting warrior serving in the Royal Elite of the Shi'ar Imperial Guard, a multi-ethnic group of super-powered alien beings who act as enforcers of the laws of the Shi'ar Empire. Created by Chris Claremont and Dave Cockrum, the character first appeared in X-Men #107 (October 1977). Titan and expand his body to giant size, and has superhuman strength and mass. (Like many original members of the Imperial Guard, Titan is the analog of a character from DC Comics' Legion of Super-Heroes: in his case Colossal Boy.[98])Titan was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutants known as the X-Men who sought to rescue the Princess Lilandra from her insane brother emperor D'Ken. Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men on a nameless Shi'ar Empire planet, and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor.[99]Some time later, when Deathbird was empress, Titan joined the other Imperial Guard members in battle against Excalibur and the Starjammers. Titan fought Captain Britain.[100] Later, on Deathbird's behalf, Titan assisted the other Imperial Guardsmen in battle against the X-Men and Starjammers, but was defeated by them.[101]Later, after Lilandra became leader of the Shi'ar Empire, Titan was amongst a small group of Imperial Guard that defended their Empress Lilandra against the Kree super-team known as Starforce, during the war between the Shi'ar and Kree Empires.  Titan battled the Supremor android.[102] Titan also joined in the Imperial Guard's battle with the Avengers on the Shi'ar throne world of Chandilar during the Kree-Shi'ar War, but was defeated by the Scarlet Witch.[103]Ronan the Accuser subsequently led the Kree in a surprise attack against the Shi'ar, using the Inhumans as an army to disrupt the Shi'ar control of the Kree. Appearing over the city of Attilan, Ronan seized control in a surprise attack and forces the Inhumans and their king, Black Bolt, to obey, or he would destroy their only home and everyone in it. He compelled Karnak, Gorgon, and Triton to covertly join the Imperial Guard, while Black Bolt and Medusa attempted the assassination of the Shi'ar ruler Lilandra at a ceremony ratifying an alliance between the Shi'ar and the Spartoi. Black Bolt managed to defeat Ronan in personal combat;[104] the attempt on Lilandra's life failed because the shapeshifting Imperial Guardsman Hobgoblin died in her place.[105]In the battle against Vulcan, Titan seemed to have been killed,[106] but was actually only seriously wounded and later reappears.[107]Titan was among the Imperial Guardsmen who attacked the Kree homeworld in "War of Kings."[108] During the assault, Hussar and Electron fought Ronan the Accuser, who was ultimately defeated by Titan.[109]The "Realm of Kings" crossover series sees the Shi'ar team up with the Starjammers to investigate "The Fault," a space-time anomaly that not only threatens Shi'ar space, but all of reality. This crisis leads to Titan's actual death (along with Starbolt, Black Light, and Neutron).[110]A new Titan is recruited from the ranks of the Subguardians and joins the Imperial Guard on a number of subsequent missions, told in such storylines as "Infinity,"[111] the "Trial of Jean Grey,"[112] "Time Runs Out,"[113] and the return of Thanos.[114]Tom Thumb (Thomas Thompson) is a member of the superhero team the Squadron Supreme. Created by Roy Thomas and John Buscema, he first appeared in The Avengers #85 (February 1971). He is a dwarf scientist and inventor. He designed the Squadron's headquarters[volume & issue needed] and frequently created advanced devices such as a Behavior Modifying Machine that could be used on criminals to change their ways, and a force field belt that protected its wearer.[volume & issue needed]The character first appears when several members of the Avengers end up in the Squadron Supreme's universe and battle them.[115] The Squadron later are manipulated by the Serpent Cartel, and the team travels to the mainstream Marvel Universe to extend the Cartel's power. They battle the Avengers once more, returning to their own universe in the process, but eventually realize that the Cartel is evil and renounce them.[116]Alongside the other Squadron members, Thumb is mind-controlled by the Over-Mind and is used in the entity's conquest of the Squadron's Earth. The team is freed by the Defenders, and together they battle and defeat the Over-Mind and Null, the Living Darkness.[117]To help restore the world after the chaos brought upon it by the Over-Mind's conquest, the Squadron resolves to take control of the planet, and the members reveal their secret identities to the world. Fellow Squadron member Nuke asks Thumb to find a cure for his parents' cancer, but Tom Thumb fails. Thumb discovers that he has also developed terminal cancer.[118] Tom Thumb then completed the Behavior Modification Machine.[119] He was captured by the Institute of Evil, and voted to expel the Golden Archer from the Squadron.[120] Tom Thumb travels to the future to steal a universal cure for disease, but he discovers it is ineffective to cure his cancer. Thumb ultimately dies at the team's headquarters in Squadron City and was placed in the Hibernaculum, a form of suspended animation that he invented to preserve the bodies of diseased or recently deceased persons until a remedy could be found for them.[121]Tom Thumb has an extraordinary genius level of intellect, but no superhuman powers. He is an expert and innovator in a wide range of scientific and technological fields, including computer science, medicine, psychology, force field technology, and spacecraft design. He possesses total recall and great physical dexterity. He is highly skilled at manipulating various weaponry of his own design. He possesses doctorate degrees in mathematics, physics, and electrical engineering. Tom Thumb has access to a variety of technologies that he has designed. He used a one-man flying vehicle that was equipped with various advanced weaponry, including guns firing concussive energy blasts. His inventions included A.I.D.A. (Artificially Intelligent Data Analyzer), a highly advanced computer with a human-like personality and sentience; the Behavior Modification Machine, which could alter the personalities and thinking processes of human powers; the Hibernaculum, a means of storing a human body in suspended animation; and the Transtemporal Somnaprojector, a means of time travel. He also invented and wore a personal force field belt, which projected a protective field of energy about the wearer that could even deflect bullets.In Supreme Power, Tom Thumb is one of a number of convicts who volunteered to act as test subjects for a military experiment, which caused him to shrink to less than one inch high.[volume & issue needed] He joins the government's Squadron Supreme program, and he enters counseling to deal with the trauma of being trapped in a capsule during one mission.[volume & issue needed] This version of the character apparently died along with the rest of his universe when it collided with another reality.[122]In the 2021 "Heroes Reborn" reality, Tom Thumb is a member of the Secret Squadron. This version resembles the original version of Tom Thumb with the size-shifting of the Supreme Power version. During the fight with Siege Society, Tom Thumb was subdued by Hawkeye. Following the fight with the Siege Society, Tom Thumb's arm is in a sling as he, Nighthawk, and Blur mourn the deaths of their fallen comrades Amphibian, Arcanna Jones, Blue Eagle, and Golden Archer.[123]Tomazooma is a gigantic robot designed to resemble a Native American deity of the Keewazi people. The Red Star Oil Company built the robot to frighten the Keewazi into giving up their oil-rich land. Tomazooma fought Wyatt Wingfoot and the Fantastic Four, who defeated it.[124]When next seen, Tomazooma had been rebuilt into a cuckoo clock being used at a Bar With No Name. The Reanimator got his hands on Tomazooma and built it back to its original specifications. When the New Warriors attacked the Reanimator, Nova blew a hole through Tomazooma's chest.[125]Valeria Toomes is the daughter of Adrian Toomes in Marvel Comics. The character, created by Robert Rodi and John Higgins.Prior to being the Vulture, Adrian had a daughter named Valeria with Cheryl Toomes. When the family found themselves on the run, Cheryl abandoned Adrian at the grief of Valeria. Years later, Valeria joined S.H.I.E.L.D. under the name Valeria Jessup in the hopes of disconnecting herself from her criminal father. When A.I.M. got a hold of her true identity in an effort to blackmail her, Valeria got in touch with her father to retrieve the Identity Disc, a disc containing the files on every costumed hero and villain and their true names. Valeria posed as Valeria Merrick and hired the Vulture along with Deadpool, Juggernaut, Sandman, Bullseye and Sabretooth. Claiming that she worked for Tristram Silver, Valeria "kills" Sandman to snap everyone in line. Everything went according to plan with the team retaining the disc which ended up going to S.H.I.E.L.D. Valeria has a bittersweet reunion when her father returns to prison while she continues to work at S.H.I.E.L.D. as Jessup.Elements of Valeria Toomes's character are essentially merged into Liz Allan (Laura Harrier) in Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017).Torgo first appeared in Fantastic Four #91 and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.[126]Torgo possesses superhuman strength and durability; he is composed of an unknown metal.[127]Torgo appears in the Avengers Assemble episode "Mojo World", voiced by Roger Craig Smith.[128]Tower was a mutant  in the Marvel Comics universe. The character, created by Bob Layton and Jackson Guice, first appeared in X-Factor #2 (March 1986). Tower draws on additional extra-dimensional mass to shrink his dimensions or augment his physical size, strength, and density.Within the context of the stories, Tower fought the original X-Factor as a member of the Alliance of Evil, a group of mutants banded together by Apocalypse. He was killed by the X-Cutioner in The Uncanny X-Men Annual #17.Larry Trask is a fictional character in Marvel Comics, the mutant son of scientist Bolivar Trask, creator of the Sentinels. The character first appeared in X-Men #57 (June 1969) and was created by Roy Thomas and Neal Adams.At the age of five, Larry's mutant power of precognition manifested when he predicted the death of his mother.[129] He lost his older sister Tanya soon after, as she was a mutant time-traveler who had become lost in the timestream.Fearful of the "mutant menace," Bolivar crafted a medallion that would block Larry's powerful visions of the future, as well as erase any memory of them.[130] As his son grew older, Bolivar enlisted Larry's help in the creation of the first wave of Sentinels. Bolivar occasionally removed Larry's medallion so that he could secretly observe and record Larry's predictions about mutants in the future, and Larry accurately predicted the assassination attempt of Senator Robert Kelly.[volume & issue needed]Larry was skeptical of his father's hatred of mutants, until the night his sister Tanya (now calling herself Madame Sanctity) returned to the past. Tanya hoped to change the future by stopping her father's creation of the Sentinels, but she was thwarted by her friend Rachel Summers. Though Rachel successfully prevented Larry from witnessing the psychic duel that ensued, she could not hide the physical damage caused by the fight. This convinces Larry that dangerous mutants do exist.[volume & issue needed]Larry Trask later blames the X-Men for his father's death, and used Bolivar's notes to create a new, stronger wave of Sentinels. He was aided in his effort by Federal Judge Robert Chalmers, who was a friend of Bolivar's and knew Larry's secret.[129] Larry Trask created a base for his Sentinels inside the Colorado Rockies, and he ordered the robots to abduct and detain all known mutants. One of these mutants was Alex Summers; Larry gave him a containment suit to control his unstable powers.[131] Chalmers became disillusioned with Larry's plans, and he forcefully removed Larry's medallion, hoping that Larry would cease his attacks on mutants if he learned the truth about his own mutation. This, however, backfired; when a furious Larry gave the order for Sentinels to destroy all mutants, he himself was targeted for annihilation.[130]The Sentinels are eventually outwitted by Cyclops, and fly into the sun (perceived by them as the source of all mutations) to apparently be destroyed.[129] Meanwhile, Larry has plunged into a state of catatonic shock, and Chalmers puts the medallion back on him to erase the knowledge of what had happened to him.[132]The Mark II Sentinels later return from space, and abduct the Scarlet Witch as part of an elaborate plan to prevent the birth of future mutants by sterilizing humanity. Larry is abducted by the Scarlet Witch's brother Quicksilver, who remembers Trask from when he and his sister were previously abducted by the Sentinels.[129] Quicksilver removes Larry's medallion, restoring Larry's knowledge of a Sentinel base in Australia.[133] The duo travels to the secret base, and Larry stops the Sentinels by revealing that the lead Sentinel was mutated during its time in space, causing the others to turn on it and destroy it, thus deactivating themselves. One of the Sentinels falls onto Larry and kills him.[133]Trauma, real name Troh-Maw, was the son of Lord Armageddon, the ruler of an extraterrestrial race known as the Troyjans. Trauma came to Earth to collect on a debt from the Pantheon's leader Agamemnon, who had promised the Troyjans one of his descendants in exchange for technology to extend his children's lifespans. Trauma often stormed the Pantheon's headquarters to take Atalanta, who always drew him back. After the Hulk joined the Pantheon, Trauma cornered Atalanta in the Himalayas and confessed his love for her, but was defeated by the Hulk before he could kidnap her. Trauma later abducted Atalanta and brought her to his homeworld, with the Hulk and the Pantheon in pursuit. The Hulk arrived in time to stop the wedding and challenged Trauma to a duel. Their fight ended when Trauma stumbled over a piece of armor and pierced his heart. Before dying, Trauma proved his love to Atalanta by releasing the Pantheon from their debt and begging Lord Armageddon to allow the Pantheon to return to Earth.[135]Roland Treece is a fictional character appearing in Marvel Comics.

She was created by Dan Abnett and Liam Sharp, and first appeared in Death's Head #3 (February 1993).Tuck is a Replicated Organic, an artificial human created on a planet called Lionheart. She was illegally created by a "tissue broker", who, fearing the authorities (all higher technology is forbidden), sold her to a brothel. She escaped and eventually joined Death's Head and his group of outlaws, and accompanied him on his complex travels through time and alternate universes.[volume & issue needed]During an unspecified time she was intentionally infected by a (eventually harmless) strain of the "plague perfection" - a synthetic virus designed to target only replicated humans and cyborgs. The search produced nothing, as there is no cure.Tuck is a synthetic human, designed to be slightly superior to a normal human in physical abilities. She is skilled in stealth and combat using Medieval weapons. At one point she gains a powerful cosmic artifact called the Sapphire Lotus which boosts her strength and durability to many times greater than normal, and grants her the power to generate large amounts of energy. She later loses all but a small shard of this object, which still boosts her strength fivefold, and increases her athletic abilities and healing rate.John Keane is a costumed criminal acrobat. Intending to test himself against Captain America, he broke into Avengers Mansion. He easily beat Captain America in two separate struggles—although, this turned out to be the Super-Adaptoid, who had taken Captain America's form and lacked his fighting skills. The real Captain America freed himself from the Adaptoid's trap and defeated the Tumbler in combat.[volume & issue needed][140]Later, the Tumbler was hired by Quentin Harderman as a part of the Secret Empire's plot to discredit Captain America. The Tumbler robbed a store, and Captain America tried to capture him but the Tumbler escaped. The next day, John Keane in civilian clothes was told to meet Captain America at a charity boxing match; however the Captain recognized Keane and he ran. Captain America knocked Keane down with his shield, and as the two struggled, the first Moonstone shot and killed Keane with a micro laser under orders from Harderman while hiding out of sight. Harderman accused Captain America of murdering the Tumbler as part of the scheme to discredit him.[141]It was later revealed that John Keane was using his ill-gotten gains that he had taken as the Tumbler to pay for his mother's living and her home, while his brother Michael was in the army. He had also taken out a million-dollar life insurance policy with the Guardian Life Insurance Policy. When Michael tried to collect on this policy, Guardian Life Insurance Policy refused to pay the claim since John had been killed in an illegal act. Michael trained hard and took on his brother's identity as the Tumbler, getting Captain America's help to expose the insurance company's fraud.[142]After receiving the Tumbler gear from Michael Keane, Roderick Kingsley sold it to an unnamed criminal. Tumbler, Ringer, and Steeplejack are shown to be in the services of Roderick Kingsley. They were later ambushed by the Goblin King's servants Menace and Monster (the "Goblin" form of Carlie Cooper).[143]Tundra is a mystical spirit which inhabits an ever-growing mass of Canadian land in gargantuan semi-humanoid form, and is the enemy of the Inuit gods whom he trapped in another dimension.[144] Tundra was the first of the Great Beasts confronted by Alpha Flight.[145] Tundra was summoned through a mystic ritual in which a possessed Richard Easton traced a gigantic human shape in the barren land of Canada's Northwest Territories and then donned a metallic crown that summoned the spirit of Tundra. Easton's corpse animated, the land mimicking the corpse's movement until Tundra rose in the shape of a humanoid mass of earth. According to Shaman, Tundra was supposed to be controlled by the mind of the human who summoned him but because of the weakened state of Richard Easton when summoning Tundra, Tundra's real personality quickly took over.[volume & issue needed] Tundra's powers stem from the land itself. He can summon mosquitoes, hurl boulders from his body, increase his size by absorbing land mass, and is connected to the land so if he is injured, earthquake-style upheavals occur in the surrounding area.Twilight was character created by Marvel Comics for their Marvel 2099 run X-Nation 2099. This short-lived series only lasted six issues before being terminated. In the year 2099, President Doom contacted Cerebra of the X-Men 2099 to let her know about a recent prophecy about a Mutant Messiah. She undertook the task of locating and training possible candidates and bringing them to Halo City, one of which was Twilight.[volume & issue needed]Little is known about the girl before she arrived at Halo City, but she soon became a part of the teen group X-Nation. It was some time later that Avian decided to mount a mission to recapture Willow in a bid to be the first to find the messiah for himself. He attacked the children and succeeded in capturing Willow again. Wanting to rescue their friend, X-Nation decided to infiltrate the Million Palms facility and save her. At first, Twilight was unwilling to go but after she misheard a conversation between Cerebra and Sister Nicholas where she thought they were going to experiment on the children she agreed. However, their fledgling efforts ended in their capture. They were able to escape, but upon their return home they found that Halo City was devastated.[volume & issue needed]Their home had been blown up by the Atlantean army and was being flooded. To add insult to injury, Exodus had awoken from another century-long slumber and tried to make X-Nation his Acolytes. They refused and were subsequently beaten, but Twilight was one of the few who implicitly didn't trust Exodus. The rest of the group joined her opinion when Exodus refused to save the human population of Halo City and they refused to be in service to him. Twilight tried to strike down the powerful mutant with her powers, but he was actually able to leave her "sphere of influence" unharmed. He struck back at her, nearly killing her if not for the magical intervention of Mademoiselle Strange. After Clarion sacrificed himself in the battle with Exodus, the rest of the kids were teleported away by Mlle Strange to face their uncertain futures.[volume & issue needed]They travel to the Savage Land—the last inhabitable place on earth—and begin to form a society there. Twilight travels to Mars with December, Metalsmith, and several others to see if the red planet has any resources that can be used by the colonists. They get attacked by aliens and crash land, but make it to the Ares base. While there, the resident doctor tells them that lately their children had begun to be abducted at night by aliens called the "Takers".[volume & issue needed]Later that night, Twilight goes missing so December and Metalsmith go looking for her, but are ambushed. Twilight returns on her own later and explains the origin of the Takers and also that the Phalanx were about to invade earth. Not knowing what to do, Twilight decides to stay with the Takers, and Metalsmith stays with her. But neither of them decide to tell this to December, who is left behind on Mars when the couple blasts off with the Takers, who fly towards the Phalanx mother ship. They, alongside the Takers, are successful in boarding the ship, but they meet an untimely fate.[volume & issue needed]Down on earth, a robot left behind by Mister Fantastic named Franklin—who has had an enigmatic connection to the Phalanx since his creation—realizes that the Phalanx are evil. Downloading several needed programs, Franklin detonates the Phalanx ship with Twilight and Metalsmith still inside.[volume & issue needed]Twilight was capable of generating a reality warping "sphere of influence" in which she could do many things including: fly, become intangible, teleport herself and others, cause things to burn, shrink, explode, melt, or reform in various ways. She also displayed a latent form of telepathy which Exodus was unable to eavesdrop on, but whether that was one of the reality warping feats or a different mutation is unknown.Tyrannus first appeared in The Incredible Hulk #5 (January 1963), and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.[146] The character was inspired by Ayesha, the protagonist of H. Rider Haggard's 1887 novel She: A History of Adventure.[147]In the Roman Empire, Tyrannus claims to be a "sorcerer", but is actually a scientist far ahead of his time. He was exiled by King Arthur and Merlin to Subterranea, a network of caves and tunnels miles beneath the Earth's surface when he tries to conquer Britain. There Tyrannus discovers a race of orange-skinned semi-humanoid Subterraneans who are eager to find in him a new master to serve. He also discovers a pool of liquid which he drinks to maintain his youth through the centuries. The Subterraneans acquaint Tyrannus with examples and records of technology designed by the Deviants who were their original masters. Tyrannus' scientific genius enables him to master and improve upon the Deviants' scientific wonders over the centuries.  Tyrannus becomes Emperor of the Tyrannoid Subterraneans and an aspiring conqueror.[148]In the modern era, Tyrannus is finally ready to use this technology and the Subterraneans in conquering the surface world. He makes several attempts as well as fighting wars against the forces of a new arrival in Subterranea, the Mole Man.Tyrannus woos Betty Ross underground and kidnaps her with his Tyrannoids. When the Hulk challenges him, he agrees to give her back on the condition that the Hulk performs a list of nigh-impossible menial tasks. However, eventually the Hulk completes the list and causes a lot of damage in the Kingdom, and Tyrannus is forced to honor his word.[149] Tyrannus is reverted to an old man when the Mole Man captures his "fountain of youth". Tyrannus uses the Hulk as a pawn by teleporting him underground and recapturing the fountain. Banner succeeds in teleporting himself back.[150] Tyrannus forces scientist Ralph Roberts to design a gigantic robot for him to use in his war against the Mole Man, but is defeated by the X-Men.[151] He decides to gain revenge on the Hulk by using advanced technology to temporarily drive him into destructive rampages. He uses the Hulk and the robot Mogul as slaves in his war against the Mole Man.[152] He later secretly allies with Kala against the Mole Man.[153] Tyrannus projects his consciousness into a Subterranean, who attacks New York City but is thwarted by Nova.[154]In the guise of the aged Des, he became an ally of Prince Rey and the Keeper of the Flame of El Dorado, an immensely powerful cobalt energy "flame" that had been created in the Andes Mountains of South America by the Deviants and had been maintained by the people of the lost city of El Dorado. "Des" then captured the Hulk.[155] "Des" was then restored to his youthfulness, and killed Rey and the Keeper.[156] Tyrannus then merged with the Flame, allowing his consciousness to control the Flame.[157] The Hulk destroys the machinery from which the Flame arises, and the Flame, still infused with Tyrannus's consciousness, is hurled far into outer space.[158]The Abomination's atomized body later merges with the disembodied mind of Tyrannus. This gestalt being attempts to force Bruce Banner to cure this condition, but the procedure goes wrong, leaving Tyrannus' mind in the Abomination's body and returning Blonsky to a normal human form.[159] Tyrannus briefly operates as the Abomination and attacks Wonder Man,[160] and Hawkeye,[161] until Ghaur and Llyra free Tyrannus from the Abomination's body and restore him to human form; Tyrannus then adopted the guise of Dr. Tyrone.[162] As Dr. Tyrone, he transformed a number of alcoholics and drug addicts into serpent men, and enslaved Spider-Man.[163] Tyrannus then battled Daredevil and Doctor Strange. He attempted to bring Set to Earth, but was attacked by Viper and swallowed by a serpent demon.[164]Bruce Banner and Skaar later fight Tyrannus when he and the Tyrannoids attack Manhattan.[165] Tyrannus's energy sword reappears in Banner's possession during the funeral for Hercules. He gives the sword to Amadeus Cho when they are forced to battle Nightmare and Phobos.[166]Later when he tried to acquire Pandora's Box he acquired the help of Betty Ross (the Red She-Hulk) to help him in this endeavor by tricking the Hulk into opening the casing of the powerful artifact by thinking Betty was trapped inside, thus releasing its energies in the process.[167] Later in the same story arc, Red She-Hulk is shown to not only run off with Tyrannus in her Red She-Hulk form but also sleeps with him,[168] although she eventually returns to Hulk after reconciling her rebellious Hulk instincts with her human desires.[169]Tyrannus was granted superhuman longevity and youth after drinking from the Fountain of Youth in Subterranea; he is dependent on this fountain of youth to maintain his youth and immortality. He possesses various lingering psionic abilities after his merger with the cobalt "Flame of Life" in El Dorado, including telepathy, mind control of others, and the ability to drain the life force of others; these abilities have not been demonstrated in later appearances. He is an extraordinary scientific genius that Bruce Banner has acknowledged as superior to himself, and has achieved mastery of the advanced technology of the Deviants which he found in Subterranea, upon which he has made further advances. Tyrannus has limited mystic knowledge of sorcery.Tyrannus often uses ancient Roman weaponry (e.g., swords and spears), but also has access to weapons created by Deviant technology, including guns projecting various types of radiation, and other advanced technological weaponry. He has designed other devices based on Deviant technology and his own innovations, which was manufactured by Subterraneans under his supervision. These include teleportation devices, flying vehicles, and gigantic earth-borers.
