Osborn arranged for Chen to be deported back to China, leading to a bittersweet departure involving himself and Songbird.[34]The Radioactive Man reappears in The Mighty Avengers as part of People's Defense Force, China's indigenous group of metahumans. The Radioactive Man demonstrates that at close proximity he can safely absorb the radiation of Inhuman Xerogen crystals and presumably safely absorb Terrigen Mist. However, the People's Defense Force is largely defeated by an invading entity known as The Unspoken, a deposed former king of the Inhumans. The Unspoken is defeated in China by the Mighty Avengers.[35]During the Heroic Age storyline, a young man named Warhead appeared as a member of the Bastards of Evil, claiming to be the son of Radioactive Man.[36] He has been shown to have similar powers, but killed himself in a mass explosion that killed hundreds of people.[37]Radioactive Man later released a Chinese dragon made of magic in the Federal Bank Reserve.

Neutron ray bombardment gave the youth who would come to be called Warhead powers similar to the Radioactive Man.[44] While apart of a teen villainous cabal known as the Bastards of Evil, Warhead would take to reciting Dr. Chen's nihilistic and anarchical rhetoric whilst doing a suicide run to spread their message. Detonating like a nuclear bomb in the heart of Manhattan.[45]Chen Lu was a normal human until exposed to excessive amounts of radiation, which changed his skin coloring to an iridescent green, and allows him to manipulate radiation across the microwave spectrum. Abilities include radiation emission as heat, "hard" radiation (inflicting opponents with nausea, dizziness, and radiation poisoning), EMP emissions to deactivate machinery, hypnotic light and so much more.[46][47] He can also absorb nuclear radiation without harm and convert it to energy for personal use such as physical enhancement or to cauterize wounds,[48][49] create energy constructs such as force fields or golems out of radiation wit greater physical strength & resilience than his own,[50] convert different energies into any other radiology form along the electromagnetic spectrum.[51] He has shown the ability to leave behind "radiation pills", i.e. infusing a single individual with enough radiation to give him severe radiation poisoning and let the contamination spread in a large population.[52] While it was briefly implied that his radioactive makeup along with some further enhancements of his powers had left him radioactive and unable to have contact with unshielded people, he was retconned to have always been in full control of his abilities. Even so, during his tenure in the Thunderbolts, Norman Osborn had his original costume replaced with a customized radiation suit, hiding his Asian features and quelling every lingering fear about his radioactive makeup.
