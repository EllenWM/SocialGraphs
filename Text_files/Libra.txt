Although they appeared strange choices, each Avenger was selected from these particular moments in time thanks to Libra's subconscious awareness of the universal balance and the necessity of their future actions even when he was unaware of their roles, comparing his subconscious decision to being able to balance on a tightrope without being able to explain how to do so. He realised the purpose behind their selection in the final confrontation, even acknowledging that Hawkeye's presence affected his own decisions as he decided to participate in the final fight rather than just watch from the sidelines.[4]Scorpio (Jake Fury) constructed the android Zodiac members, although his plan was thwarted by the Defenders.[5] The androids Libra and Sagittarius employed costumed criminals posing as the Defenders to create chaos in New York City.[6] Quicksilver employed the android Zodiac to attack the West Coast Avengers, but the Avengers defeated the Zodiac.[7]Led by Scorpio in a new android body, the android Zodiac massacred the human Zodiac, and took over their criminal operations.
