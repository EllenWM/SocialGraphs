Hank Pym disputed Loki's explanation. Whether or not it was indeed Loki-in-disguise has not been answered.[12]Andrew Forson is the seventh character within A.I.M. to use the title of Scientist Supreme. The character first appeared in Fantastic Four #610 and was created by Jonathan Hickman and Ryan Stegman.Forson was the Scientist Supreme of A.I.M. after the organization became public and established their base in the now-sovereign island nation of Barbuda and overthrew the Wizard with consent of the rest of A.I.M.. Barbuda was then renamed A.I.M. Island.[13]Forson appears as the Supreme Leader of the new High Council of A.I.M., consisting of Graviton (as the Minister of Science), Jude the Entropic Man (as the Minister of Health), Mentallo (as the Minister of Home Affairs), Superia (as the Minister of Education in Bagalia), the female Super-Adaptoid (as the Minister of State in Bagalia), and the undercover Taskmaster (as the Minister of Defense).[14] Forson then leads A.I.M. into attending a weapons expo, which led to A.I.M. fighting against the Secret Avengers. During the battle, Forson takes the opportunity to steal the Iron Patriot armor.[15] Daisy Johnson launched an unsanctioned operation to send the Secret Avengers to A.I.M. Island to assassinate Forson, and the group seemingly killed him.

Island regarding an escaped creature.[17] An A.I.M. Agent then approaches Forson and Superia, showing the two a 2-D hologram of the organism beating the Avengers.

Island, creating in a matter of hours for the real world year of progress and transforming A.I.M. into a technologically advanced empire.[22] When Smasher comes to the island, Forson has Jude the Entropic Man transform her into his messenger.[23]Forson is an experienced scientist with genius-level intellect.
