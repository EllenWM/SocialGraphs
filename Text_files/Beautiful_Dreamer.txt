Beautiful Dreamer is a fictional mutant character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Her real name and past prior to joining the Morlocks are unknown. She followed the terrorist Morlock leader Masque for a time and committed criminal acts by manipulating others with her mental powers at his behest. However, Beautiful Dreamer's primary motivation for doing so, as with most of her fellow Morlocks, is presumed to be her desire for company and community.

She was delivered by the Leper Queen to a Friends of Humanity anti-mutant rally held in Iowa, where the virus activated her powers to the extreme, killing all of the people attending the rally by making their brains "forget" to pump their hearts; she eventually died as well because of the virus.[7]Beautiful Dreamer possesses the ability to psionically alter the memories of others using her special "dream smoke" as a focus.
