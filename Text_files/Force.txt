Wilson steals the prototype force field generator, creates a battle-suit that incorporates it, and adopts the alias "Force". The character then goes on a rampage through New York City until he was defeated by hero Namor the Sub-Mariner.[2]Force retreats and appears in the title Iron Man, having become a professional criminal, working for crime boss Justin Hammer in exchange for modifications to his suit.

Iron Man, however, tracks the yacht, defeats Force and his men and rescues the hostages.[3]Wilson eventually reappears in the title Iron Man, and decides to reform. Hammer, however, traps the character in the suit and threatens to kill him if he reneges on the agreement. Force flees and Hammer sends villains the Beetle, Blacklash, and the Blizzard II to kill him. Iron Man aids Force in stopping the villains, then lies to the authorities and advises that Wilson was killed in battle to placate Hammer. Wilson is provided with a new identity and employment with Barstow Electronics, a subsidiary of Stark Industries.[4] Analysis of Force's armor reveals that elements of it were actually based on Stark's own designs, Stark bringing in Wilson to quickly ask him where he acquired that technology, thus setting in motion the events of the Armor Wars when he learns that Justin Hammer acquired some of Stark's plans thanks to a raid carried out by Spymaster.[5] Wilson makes another brief appearance in the title Iron Man, impersonating the hero to assist Stark.[6]The character makes another appearance in Iron Man as part of the group the "Iron Legion", subsequently battling the giant robot Ultimo.[7] Force then appears in the third volume of Iron Man, and after being blackmailed travels to the country Iraq to aid Stark once again.[8]Wilson reappears as Force during the Dark Reign storyline, arresting several villains employed by the criminal the Hood.[9]Clayton Wilson designed and used a powered battle-suit incorporating the force field projector designed by Dr. Damon Walters.
