When Hulk and the hatchlings (voiced by Clancy Brown, Benjamin Diskin, and Eliza Dushku) are captured and placed in cages on Arkon's ship, it is revealed that Goom was previously captured by Arkon in his plot to raise the infant Gooms and use them to hunt Earth's heroes. Hulk and the Gooms crash Arkon's ship, and Arkon is chased away by Monster Isle's inhabitants. In the episode "Planet Monster" Pt. 2, Goom assists the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. and the Avengers in their fight against the Kree.
