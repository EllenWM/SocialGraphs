[[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] wrote and illustrated this series, with inks by [[Doug Hazlewood]].

During their time in the past, Robotman declares his love for Elasti-Girl. However, due to an age gap between the two heroes, Rita is trapped in her twelve-year-old self's body when the adult Cliff reveals his romantic feelings and kisses her. DC canceled Byrne's series with issue #18. The events in DC's ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' crossover saw the restoration of the Doom Patrol's full continuity, with the inclusion of all previous incarnations  with the reveal that Superboy Prime had \"retcon punched\" the previous versions of Doom Patrol from existence and for him to \"retcon punch\" them back into existence after being shot with an arrow that briefly imprisoned Superboy Prime into a rectangular shaped mini-Phantom Zone by Speedy II."
