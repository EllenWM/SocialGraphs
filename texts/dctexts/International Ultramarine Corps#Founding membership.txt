"==Founding membership==\n===Warmaker One===\nWarmaker One is Lieutenant Colonel Scott Sawyer who has a body composed of a type of energy which phases out of normal reality, and as such is contained in a high-tech suit of power armor. His armor is equipped with rockets, a one-shot bullet with a \"clean\" nuclear warhead, and transmitters that \"broadcast\" sounds and other sensory information, enabling him to overload Superman's super-senses.\n\n===Flow===\nFlow is Major Dan Stone, a creature of living water. As time wore on, Flow became more monstrous and less humanoid in appearance and changed his name to '''Glob'''.\n\n===4-D===\n4-D is an [[African American]] woman  Captain Lea Corben. She has the power to change her dimensions, so that she could become four-, three-, two-, or one-dimensional at will, making her hard to capture and confine. In her own words, she also stated that she had the ability to draw power \"from other dimensions and bring it into the Third Dimension\" and use it to supercharge the blows she could deal out; she promptly then proved this in battle by knocking out [[Wonder Woman]] with a single blow.\n\n===Pulse 8===\nPulse 8 is Captain John Wether. Pulse 8 was originally in control of the fundamental forces of the universe, such as [[gravity]], [[electromagnetism]] and the like. His more recent appearance, as '''The Master''', shows him using his powers to rewrite reality using something called a \"[[Quantum]] Keyboard\". It is unknown whether this is a further development of his pre-existing powers, a whole new power, or merely a new way of describing his old powers."
