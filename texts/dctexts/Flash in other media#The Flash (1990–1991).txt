"====''The Flash'' (1990\u20131991)====\n[[File:The Flash (John Wesley Shipp).jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[John Wesley Shipp]] as the titular protagonist of the television series ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]''.]]\n{{Main|The Flash (1990 TV series)}}\n\n''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]'' was a live action television series on [[CBS]] that starred [[John Wesley Shipp]] and [[Amanda Pays]]. The Flash featured in the series was an amalgamation of the silver-age Flash, Barry Allen, and the modern-age Wally West. The only resemblance between the TV Barry Allen Flash and the comic book Barry Allen Flash were his name, his profession as a forensic scientist, and his love interest [[Iris West]] played by [[Paula Marshall]] (who was very short lived as a love interest in the television series). In this version, while working as police detective, Barry was working in the crime lab at the Central City Police Department headquarters one night when a lightning bolt struck his lab, dousing him in electricity and nearby chemicals which soon gave him the ability to run at superhuman speeds, just like in the comics.\n\nThe series also included and featured an older brother for Barry named Jay Allen (named after [[Jay Garrick]] the original Flash) who was also a police officer and a motorcycle cop. Jay was killed in the line of duty by a criminal gang leader named Nicholas Pike. After that, Barry donned a special red prototype deep sea diving-suit from Russia designed to withstand friction and pressure, and called himself the Flash. By using his new costume and powers, Barry captured Pike and brought him to justice. From then on, Barry used his identity as Flash to help bring down other criminals in Central City. He became a hero full-time.\n\nMost of the elements in the television show were taken directly from the main story line in the first Wally West Flash comic books: The [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] researcher [[Tina McGee]], she and her husband's research into speed, her husband's allegedly fatal accident with their speed research, the Flash's ravenous appetite, heat problems (which were mitigated by the TV show's Flash suit), and speed limit on the order of the speed of sound were all elements from the main Wally West comic book storyline.\n\nThe Flash's most famous villain in the series was the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]], played by [[Mark Hamill]], who later went on to voice the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and, later, the Trickster in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. [[Captain Cold]], played by Michael Champion, and Mirror Master, played by [[David Cassidy]], also appeared in their own episodes. The complete series was released as a DVD set by Warner Bros. in 2006.\n\nThe ''Flash TV Special'' #1 comic introduced a variation on Kid Flash. This particular version of the character was a teenage thief named Vince Everett. Unlike the Flash, his powers did not require eating to replenish. His speed is pushed to the limit as he chases the Flash through an amusement park, eventually burning out his powers.\n\nShipp later returned to the Flash franchise twenty years after the series' cancellation; first in an episode of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]],'' titled \"Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster!\u201d voicing [[Professor Zoom]], and later in recurring roles as Barry's father Henry Allen and Henry's parallel universe counterpart Jay Garrick in [[The CW]]'s ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.\n\nAn image of Shipp's Flash appears on an episode of ''The Flash'' (2014), as [[Earth-Two|Earth-2]] [[Harrison Wells]], [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Cisco Ramon]] and Barry travel through the Arrowverse multiverse to get to Earth-2. This makes this series a part of the [[Arrowverse]] as a different universe."
